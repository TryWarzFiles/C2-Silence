> **Warning**
> Unfortunately, due to the ignorance of some dear users, we have not been informed that some profiteers and uneducated people are selling some of my scripts at a lower price. And the user does not receive anything after payment. Some of these ignorant people give malicious and virus files to users. From here, I declare that the only official source to sell my scripts is the [Telegram]()
